    "projectDetails": "This project aims to develop a robust and scalable machine learning pipeline to classify advanced kidney disease stages. Utilizing MLflow for managing the machine learning lifecycle and DVC (Data Version Control) for dataset and model versioning, the project ensures reproducibility and effective collaboration.The core goal is to build an efficient pipeline capable of tracking experiments, managing models, and optimizing machine learning workflows. The classification model, trained on kidney disease datasets, offers accurate predictions and helps healthcare providers monitor disease progression. With MLflow and DVC integrated, the solution is designed for scalability and continuous improvement, allowing healthcare institutions to maintain up-to-date models.",
